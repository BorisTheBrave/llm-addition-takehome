# llm-addition-takehome

This repository contains code for my submission for Neel Nanda's MATS stream 2025. It's a partially complete investigation into how LLMs multiple small integers. 

Note the llm-addition subdirectory is a clone of https://github.com/subhashk01/LLM-addition and is mostly not my work except changes to helix_fittings.ipynb.
